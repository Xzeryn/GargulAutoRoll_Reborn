# Debug Mode Disabled

Debug messages have been disabled in GargulAutoRoll.

## Changes Made

**File:** `GargulAutoRoll.lua`
- Line 2: Changed `DEBUG = true` to `DEBUG = false`

## To Re-enable Debug Mode

If you need to troubleshoot in the future, change line 2 back to:
```lua
DEBUG = true
```

This will enable all debug print statements throughout the addon.

## What Was Disabled

When DEBUG = false, the following will NOT print to chat:
- Item awarded/given events
- Player instance changes
- Rule save operations
- Search operations
- AtlasLoot import messages
- Interface interactions
- Item rendering details
- And all other debug messages throughout the addon

The addon will continue to function normally, just without the debug output.
